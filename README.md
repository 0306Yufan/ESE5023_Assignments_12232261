# 1st assignment review - chenyy 
Great job on the first assignment! I shall give you "103" for this assignment, including "+3" for the well-organized logical flow in the remarks. BTW, I know it is hard to avoid using the 'for' loop, try your best to optimize it when you encounter computing power problems. Keep going!
