# 1st assignment review - chenyy 
Great job on the first assignment! I shall give you "103" for this assignment, including "+3" for the well-organized logical flow in the remarks. BTW, I know it is hard to avoid using the 'for' loop, try your best to optimize it when you encounter computing power problems. Keep going!

# 2nd assignment review - chenyy 
Great job! I shall give you "103" for this assignment, including "+3" for the well-organized logical flow and detailed remarks in the remarks. Besides, please try to avoid or turn off the warning massege, or it might mess up your report. Keep going!
